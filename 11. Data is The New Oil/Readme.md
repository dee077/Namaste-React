#### In tailwind.config.js, what does all the keys mean (content, theme, extend,plugins)?
- In tailwind.config.js, the keys content, theme, extend, and plugins are used to configure different aspects of Tailwind CSS:
- Content: The content key allows you to define additional content styles, such as custom font families, text sizes, line heights, and letter spacings. You can add or override content-related styles within this section.
- Theme: The theme key is one of the most important parts of the configuration file. It allows you to customize the default design system of Tailwind CSS by specifying colors, typography settings, spacing scales, breakpoints, and more. You can define your own values for these properties or extend the existing ones.
- Extend: The extend key lets you extend or override Tailwind CSS utility classes with your custom utility classes. This is useful when you need to add new utility classes or modify existing ones to match your project's specific design requirements. You can extend Tailwind's default utility classes with additional styles or variants.
- Plugins: The plugins key enables you to add custom plugins to Tailwind CSS, allowing you to extend its functionality beyond what's provided out of the box. Plugins can be used to add new utility classes, apply transformations to existing classes, or optimize your CSS output. You can define your plugins or use community-contributed plugins to enhance Tailwind CSS's capabilities.

#### Why do we have .postcssrc file?
- The .postcssrc file allows developers to configure PostCSS according to their project's specific needs. It provides a centralized location to define PostCSS plugins, options, and other settings.
