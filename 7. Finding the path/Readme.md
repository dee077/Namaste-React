#### What is SPA?
- SPA stands for Single Page Application. It is a type of web application that operates within a single web page. In a SPA, the entire application UI is loaded initially as a single HTML page, usually containing CSS and JavaScript files. The content of the page is dynamically updated as the user interacts with the application, without requiring the entire page to be reloaded from the server.
 
#### What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
- In client-side routing, the routing and navigation logic is handled entirely by the client-side code running in the user's web browser.
- In server-side routing, the routing and navigation logic is handled by the server. When a user navigates to a different route or URL, the browser sends a request to the server for the corresponding resource.
